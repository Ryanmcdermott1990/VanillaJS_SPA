**UNDER CONSTRUCTION** 

A vanilla JS SPA front end, to be layered in front of a Laravel backend by making Fetch requests to API endpoints.

This is V3 of the intitial idea which is leveraging a lightweight and custom JS framework, Leaf which has been developed by a senior collegue Luke Fordham. (big shout out to Luke who is both a friend and coding mentor)

The framework accomodates;

- Nested component rendering
- Component transitioning 
- Managing state within your web application 
- Shallow routing 

It was a great experience to learn about how to recreate a JS framework and has taught me a lot about what goes on behind the scenes to create the magic of JS frameworks.

The next steps for this application are;

- Find a way to render the App in index to improve code resuability and prevent reloading of the page 
- Request a list of posts from the Laravel backend to be displayed in a table in the front end
- Implement a login mechanism to allow for an admin user to craete a post that is posted to my db 
- Create a basic contact form that sends an email and is protected by Captcha 
- Host and deploy other projects sites so I can add them in to my SPA 
- Host and deploy the SPA
